== Description ==

<p style="margin:0;"><img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso/assets/icon-256x256.png"></p>

**WPSSO creates *complete* and *accurate* meta tags and Schema markup:**

WPSSO Core offers meta tags and Schema markup for Facebook / Open Graph, Google's Knowledge Graph and Rich Card SEO, Pinterest Rich Pins, Twitter Cards, Weibo and more &mdash; including complete image markup, video markup, extensive eCommerce product markup, author profile / authorship, co-authors, publisher information, local business markup, aggregate ratings, reviews, recipe information, event details, and much, much more &mdash; all from your existing content.

**WPSSO uses your *existing content* for meta tags and Schema markup:**

There's no need to manually re-enter descriptions, titles, select images / videos &mdash; WPSSO Core reads all your existing WordPress content automatically, and you can optionally fine-tune and customize just about anything and everything. ;-) WPSSO Core is also language / locale aware, allowing you to customize your site information for different languages!

**WPSSO includes advanced *quality control* features and options:**

WPSSO Core checks for minimum / maximum image dimensions and aspect ratios, shows notices for missing and required images, verifies your webpages for duplicate meta tags, validates theme header templates for correct HTML markup, warns of any missing PHP modules, and checks 3rd party plugin settings for possible conflicts.

**WPSSO offers special meta tags and features for Pinterest:**

WPSSO Core provides a specific image and image dimensions for the Pinterest Pin It button, excludes non-relevant images from being detected by Pinterest, and prevents conflicts between incompatible Pinterest and Facebook meta tag values.

**WPSSO can integrate and enhance your favorite SEO plugin:**

WPSSO Core specializes in providing all the meta tags and Schema markup social sites and search engines need &mdash; and you can still continue to use your favorite SEO content / keyword analysis tools without any conflicts! The Pro version even comes with special integration modules for All in One SEO Pack, The SEO Framework, WP Meta SEO, Yoast SEO, and more.

<h3>Users Love the WPSSO Core Plugin</h3>

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "The plugin is indispensable to me when it comes to posting on social media... it makes it so that your posts look the best that they possible can every time when posting on Facebook, Twitter, or any other site." - [monsuirette](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/this-is-probably-the-best-plugin-of-its-kind/)

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "I've tried a number of WP SEO platforms and find this to be the most relevant and most completely thought-out platform for maximising web and social search results and presentation. Really impressed. Great support too!" - [pixmoto](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/best-seo-platform-on-the-market/)

&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; &mdash; "Yoast on steroids! As an SEO marketer, I love using Yoast for my basic on-page SEO. But Yoast only allows you to enter basic Open Graph social settings. This plugin gives you SO many more options on completing the Open Graph for Facebook, Twitter cards, Pinterest etc. If you use WordPress, I totally recommend using this SEO plugin to help with better rankings in the SERPS!" - [gregmontag](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/yoast-on-steroids/)

<h3>Release Schedule</h3>

<p>New versions of the plugin are released approximately every week (more or less). New features are added, tested, and released incrementally, instead of grouping them together in a major version release. When minor bugs fixes and/or code improvements are applied, new versions are also released. This release schedule keeps the code stable and reliable, at the cost of more frequent updates.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_early,_release_often">release early, release often (RERO) software development philosophy</a> on Wikipedia for more information on the benefits of smaller / more frequent releases.</p>

<h3>Version Numbering</h3>

Version components: `{major}.{minor}.{bugfix}[-{stage}.{level}]`

* {major} = Major structural code changes / re-writes or incompatible API changes.
* {minor} = New functionality was added or improved in a backwards-compatible manner.
* {bugfix} = Backwards-compatible bug fixes or small improvements.
* {stage}.{level} = Pre-production release: dev < a (alpha) < b (beta) < rc (release candidate).

<h3>Free / Standard Version Repositories</h3>

Save the plugin settings, and click the "Check for Updates" button to fetch the latest / current WPSSO Core version information. When new development versions are available, they can be installed under the Dashboard &gt; Updates page (like any other plugin update).
